# Whisper-Voice-Transcription
Script is a voice recording and transcription tool that uses several libraries to record audio, transcribe it, and then paste the transcription into the current active window. The script is designed to be controlled through keyboard shortcuts, specifically using the Ctrl+R combination to start and stop recording.
